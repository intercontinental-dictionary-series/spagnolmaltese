# Source directory

This directory contains the "raw" source data of the dataset from which the
CLDF dataset in [`cldf/`](../cldf) is derived.


## Notes

> Please note in each pair of adjacent fields, the Maltese orthographic representation and the IPA pronunciation are given. Since this takes up six horizontal fields, and since for some entries there are more than three equivalents, some entries continue beyond the Comments column into the remaining Column columns.
